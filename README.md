## Overview

This project implements an intelligent form system that combines QuillForms with AI capabilities to create an engaging user experience. The system leverages OpenAI's technologies for voice interaction and integrates with existing CRM systems through Zapier.

## Features

### Form Building (QuillForms)
- Sleek, branded form experience
- Two-part form structure:
  - Basic form for initial information
  - Optional detailed form for additional data
- Hidden captcha for secure email capture

### AI Integration
- Real-time speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
- Dynamic form filling with GPT-4
- Voice interaction with fallback to manual input
- Interactive button prompt: *"Wanna do it the easy way? click here!"*

### Data Management
- Seamless Zapier integration with CRM systems
- Field-by-field data syncing
- Automated follow-up system for abandoned forms
- Personalized email recovery system
